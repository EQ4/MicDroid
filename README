This Android application auto-tunes your voice!

Known issues:
Ridiculously choppy (Android sound api limitations?)
Doesn't work on HTC Evo 4G (cannot initialize audio record correctly?)

To Do:
Write to a .wav file instead of instantly playing back via speaker, to get around the
choppiness issues.

This project uses Autotalent from http://web.mit.edu/tbaran/www/autotalent.html
