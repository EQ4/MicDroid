This Android application auto-tunes your voice!

Known issues:
Must write as PCM wav, since we do not have an API to access encoders
Must write to a wav file before processing since we do not have cpu time to do on the fly processing
UGLY!

To Do:
ADD GRAPHICS
Implement timeline/progress bar for playback
Save application state on rotate
More settings from Auto-Tune settings menu option
Add 'About' menu option
Add 'Help' menu option

This project uses Autotalent from http://web.mit.edu/tbaran/www/autotalent.html
