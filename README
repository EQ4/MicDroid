This Android application auto-tunes your voice!

Known issues:
Must write as PCM wav, since we do not have an API to access encoders
Must write to a wav file before processing since we do not have cpu time to do on the fly processing
UGLY!

To Do:
Fix clickability/highlighting on recording library view
Implement timeline/progress bar for playback

This project uses Autotalent from http://web.mit.edu/tbaran/www/autotalent.html
