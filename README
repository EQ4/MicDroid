This Android application auto-tunes your voice!
Now available under MIT license, excepting the modified Autotalent plugin,
which is still under GPL2

Known Issues:
Must write as PCM wav, since we do not have an API to access encoders
Must write to a wav file before processing since we do not have cpu time to do on the fly processing
No graphics
Force closes reported on G1, MyTouch3G, Galaxy S

To Do:
Add new nicer graphic resources for everything
Add minor keys
Share as MMS, set as ringtone option, rename recording options for recordings
Fix thread sync when failure on record thread occurs: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/thread-signaling.html
Make preferences seekbar based: http://www.mail-archive.com/android-developers@googlegroups.com/msg19042.html
Add 'About' menu option, including license information
Add 'Help' menu option
Use directbuffer for JNI data transfers?
Add option to playback tracks while recording (auto-cancellation is difficult??)

This project uses Autotalent from http://web.mit.edu/tbaran/www/autotalent.html
which was created originally by Tom Baran.
