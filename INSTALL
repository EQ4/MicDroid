This project requires:
Android SDK
Android NDK

This project does not contain the NDK makefile for the autotalent C library.
In order to build it, you must first install the Android NDK from http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Installing the Android NDK is beyond the scope of this INSTALL file.
Then you must create the NDK makefile for the project by going to the NDK install directory, and create 
the application makefile, Application.mk which should contain:

APP_PROJECT_PATH := /path/to/MicDroid
APP_MODULES := autotalent

in <ndk top level>/apps/autotalent 
From the <ndk top level> directory, you can then issue make APP=autotalent to compile the autotalent.so library.
