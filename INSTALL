This project requires:
Android SDK
Android NDK
libwave

This project does not contain the shared libraries for autotalent or lame.
In order to build them, you must first install the Android NDK from:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Installing the Android NDK is beyond the scope of this INSTALL file.

Then you must go to the project top level and issue the command:
/path/to/ndk-build 
to build the libraries.
The NDK builder will compile the shared libraries and place them in the /libs
directory.

You must also have libwave for the MicDroid project to reference. It is an
Android library project, so the Android builders will include it automatically.
